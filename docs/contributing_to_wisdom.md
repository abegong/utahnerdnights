### Contributing to /wisdom

PRs into wisdom.html typically look like this:
```
<!------------ This is one card ------------>
<div class="card mb-1">
    <div class="card-body">
        <h5 class="card-title">[[[Pithy wisdom goes here]]]</h5>
        <p class="card-text">[[[A short, twitter-length explanation goes here.]]]</p>
        <p class="float-right">- <a href="[[[your social media URL]]]" target="_blank">[[[Your name]]]</a></p>
    </div>
</div>
```

Please do:
* be as concise as you possibly can.
* exactly match styling and indentation levels
* add your card at the bottom of one of the columns, keeping the column heights roughly equal.

Optional: 
* include your name and a link to social media. Not required, but it's a nice way to establish social proof.
